# Cardano + Unity + Weld

This is under heavy WIP, I was just curious to integrate weld (universal wallet connector made by Anvil).
So far it works with a small game I built with Deno and HTMX.

**Useful links**

- Weld: https://github.com/Cardano-Forge/weld (The current code for weld has been compiled and sent manually, it works with HTMX and Unity, this is propably not the latest version.)

My backend is built using the libs I made with CSL.
